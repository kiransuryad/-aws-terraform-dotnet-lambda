# Introduction
 This Terraform code project provides an example of how to deploy a .NET sample application to AWS Lambda using S3. The sample application is a simple C# function that takes an input string and returns it as output. The application is deployed to Lambda as a ZIP package stored in an S3 bucket.

The code in this project includes Terraform configuration files for creating the S3 bucket, packaging and uploading the application code to the bucket, and creating the Lambda function with the S3 bucket as the source for the code.
